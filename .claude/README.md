## Complete Connector Development Workflow

### üéØ Phase 1: API Discovery & Analysis

1. **Analyze the API** **(Enriched with ADS-B patterns)**
   ```
   Use the api-schema-analyzer agent to analyze the API response from [API_URL] and generate initial schemas
   ```
   - Examines API responses with real-world extraction patterns
   - Generates JSON schemas following registry standards
   - Creates both raw and extracted schema variants for ETL pipelines
   - Identifies data structures with proper indexing strategies
   - **Real Example**: *Generated complete aircraft tracking schemas from ADS-B.lol API*

2. **Validate Against Specification** **(95% Compliance Patterns)**
   ```
   Use the api-connector-spec-validator to check if our structure meets the registry requirements
   ```
   - Ensures compliance with `api-connector.mdx` requirements
   - Validates registry directory structure (CEO-emphasized importance)
   - Checks required metadata files and _scaffold alignment
   - **Real Example**: *ADS-B connector systematic validation achieving 95% compliance*

### üîß Phase 2: Implementation

3. **Build the Client** **(Production Resilience)**
   ```
   Use the connector-client-builder agent to create a robust HTTP client for [API_NAME] with rate limiting
   ```
   - Implements structured error handling with correlation IDs
   - Adds three-state circuit breaker patterns (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN)
   - Configures token bucket rate limiting with server feedback
   - Sets up retry logic with exponential backoff + jitter
   - **Real Example**: *ADS-B client achieving enterprise-grade reliability*

4. **Add Data Transformation** **(Security-Conscious)**
   ```
   Use the data-transformation-expert to design ETL pipelines for converting raw API data
   ```
   - Creates type-safe field mappings without vulnerabilities
   - Implements schema validation avoiding ReDoS patterns
   - Handles data normalization with structured error reporting
   - **Real Example**: *Secure email validation replacing ReDoS-vulnerable regex*

5. **Ensure TypeScript Quality**
   ```
   Use the typescript-expert to review and optimize TypeScript patterns in the connector
   ```
   - Designs robust interfaces
   - Implements type guards
   - Optimizes compilation

### üß™ Phase 3: Testing & Security

6. **Create Test Suite**
   ```
   Use the connector-testing-specialist to build comprehensive tests for the connector
   ```
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests with API
   - Mock server setup
   - Performance benchmarks

7. **Security Audit** **(Real Vulnerability Detection)**
   ```
   /security-check
   ```
   Or:

   Use the security-auditor to review the connector implementation for vulnerabilities
   ```
   - Detects ReDoS vulnerabilities like those caught by GitHub alerts
   - Reviews credential sanitization in logging
   - Validates input sanitization without introducing new vulnerabilities
   - **Real Example**: *ReDoS vulnerability detection and fix in ADS-B connector*

### üìö Phase 4: Documentation & Review

9. **Architecture Review**
   ```
   Use the connector-architecture-reviewer to validate the connector design and patterns
   ```
   - Reviews code organization

   - Ensures best practices

10. **Pattern Validation**
    ```
    Use the google-analytics-pattern-auditor to ensure consistency with reference implementations
    ```
    - Compares against GA connector
    - Validates documentation format
    - Checks testing patterns

### ‚ö° Phase 5: Optimization & Production

11. **Performance Optimization**
    ```
    /optimize
    ```
    Or:
    ```
    Use the performance-optimizer to analyze and improve connector performance
    ```
    - Profiles execution
    - Optimizes HTTP patterns
    - Reduces memory usage

12. **Add Reliability Features**
    ```
    Use the api-reliability-engineer to add production resilience patterns
    ```
    - Implements circuit breakers
    - Adds monitoring hooks
    - Handles API versioning

13. **Debug Issues**
    ```
    Use the connector-debugger to troubleshoot any API connection or data issues
    ```
    - Analyzes error patterns
    - Debugs transformations
    - Investigates performance

"Create a Shopify connector in Python"
"I need a connector for the Weather API in TypeScript"

# Claude will automatically:
# 1. Use api-schema-analyzer
# 2. Guide you through each phase
# 3. Apply language-specific patterns
# 4. Generate appropriate integration examples (React for TS, Django/FastAPI for Python)
